        <h2>Lifespan and Commitment:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p>
            Rats typically live for 2 to 3 years. While this may seem short, it’s essential to ensure you’re ready for the time, care, and commitment they require when aging fast.<br>
            They need daily interaction, mental stimulation, and consistent care. Consider how their needs fit into your current and future lifestyle.<br>
            If you’re away often or your schedule is busy, make sure you can dedicate at least two hours day to them or have someone to help.<br>
            With good care there are no low maintanance pets.

      <section class="grid-section2">
        <h2>Temperament and Handling:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p> : Rats are intelligent, curious, and social, but they require gentle and patient handling, especially when they are new to your home.<br>
            Young or shy rats may need time to build trust sometimes being skittish for weeks before they fully feel comfortable in their new environment. Learn about proper ways to pick them up and interact without stressing them.

      <!-- Third Grid -->
      <section class="grid-section2">
        <h2>Initial Costs and Supplies:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p>
            Getting rats involves an initial investment in high-quality supplies, which can be more costly than anticipated.<br>
            Beyond the cage, you’ll need bedding, food, toys, water bottles, hiding spaces, and climbing structures. Don’t forget potential adoption fees.

      <!-- Fourth Grid -->
      <section class="grid-section2">
        <h2>Veterinary Care and Costs:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p> Rats can suffer from health issues like respiratory infections, tumors, and dental problems, which may require medical attention.<br>
            Research exotic pet veterinarians in your area who specialize in small animals and ensure you're financially prepared for potential vet bills.<br>
            Plan for preventive care, such as a proper diet and a clean living environment, to reduce the likelihood of illness.

      <!-- Fifth Grid -->
      <section class="grid-section2">
        <h2>Companionship:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p> : Never get one rat! Rats are highly social animals and thrive in the company of other rats. A single rat can become lonely and very depressed.<br>
            Always adopt at least two rats of the same gender to prevent unintended breeding.<br>
            Ensure you have time to bond with your rats daily, even if they have cage mates.
