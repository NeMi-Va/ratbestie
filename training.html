          <p>
            Only use positive reinforcement!
            Negative reinforcement will only associate you with negative feelings and lead to worse trust from your rats.<br>
            Teach basic commands like responding to oneâ€™s name when called.<br>
            For more fun, teach simple commands like spin, nose (touch your finger with nose), and backwards walking.

        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p> Expose pets to different people, other rats, and environments to develop well-adjusted behavior and minimize the risk of the rat becoming/staying skittish.<br>
            Try to desensitize them to loud sounds like vacuum cleaner as soon as possible to reduce the stress they may experience when they are older.

            Address issues like unwanted chewing by providing appropriate entertainment and physical exercise for your pocket puppies by using e.g., rat safe toys, chew treats, providing a well-sized running wheel, and playing with your rats every roaming session.<br>
            Entertained rat means unchewed books, sheets, and furniture!
