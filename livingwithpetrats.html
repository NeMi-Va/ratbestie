    <h1>Living With Pet Rats</h1>

      <!-- First Grid -->
      <section class="grid-section2">
        <h2>Cage:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p>
            Get an appropriately sized cage for your pets! <br>
            The usual recommendation is 2 cubic feet per rat but if you can buy a bigger cage, please do it! <br>
            So, the more rats you have, the larger the cage should be. If you have two rats it should be up to 4 cubic feet at a minimum.<br>
            Avoid cedar or pine bedding, as the aromatic oils can harm their respiratory system. Choose paper-based or felt bedding instead.

          <h2>Letting the rats out of their cage:</h2>
          <div class="grid-container2">
            <p> It is crucial to let your rats out of their cage no matter the cage size.<br>
              Let rats out at least 2 times a day 1 hour at a time.<br>
              By letting your rats roam in a controlled environment, you bond with them as well as make their lives a lot more fun!

              <p>
                Close all the holes through which your fur baby can escape to explore the unknown territories by using hard-to-chew items. <br>
                Don’t use cloths as rats will pull them out nor e.g., cardboard as rats will chew threw it. <br>
                Hide anything and everything you don’t want to be bitten or chewed.<br>
                Even if the rat is not trying to eat your stuff their curious nature will often make them try everything by chewing it a little.<br>
                Before letting the rats out always remember to close all the needed doors/cabinets.<br>

              <div class="grid-container2">
                <p> Because rats are prey animals, they need spaces to hide to feel comfortable.<br>
                  Provide cardboard boxes or old sheets where the rats can burrow.

                  <p>
                    Rats love to climb, hence try to allow them to climb where they want. <br>
                    If the climbing spot is not safe close it off by using pet fences or an improvised fence from e.g., big container lid. <br>
                    If possible, get them a cat tree to climb onto. <br>
