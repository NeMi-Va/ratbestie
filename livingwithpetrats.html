        <h1>Living With Pet Rats</h1>
        <p><ul>Cage:
<li>Get an appropriately sized cage for your pets!</li>
<li>The usual recommendation is 2 cubic feet per rat but if you can buy a bigger cage, please do it! So, the more rats you have, the larger the cage should be. If you have two rats it should be up to 4 cubic feet at a minimum.</li>
Letting the rats out of their cage:
<li>It is crucial to let your rats out of their cage no matter the cage size.</li>
<li>Let rats out at least 2 times a day 1 hour at a time.</li>
<li>By letting your rats roam in a controlled environment, you bond with them as well as make their lives a lot more fun!</li>
Rat proofing the roaming space:
<li>Close all the holes through which your fur baby can escape to explore the unknown territories by using hard-to-chew items.</li>
<li>Don’t use cloths as rats will pull them out nor e.g., cardboard as rats will chew threw it.</li>
<li>Hide anything and everything you don’t want to be bitten or chewed.</li>
<li>Even if the rat is not trying to eat your stuff their curious nature will often make them try everything by chewing it a little.</li>
<li>Before letting the rats out always remember to close all the needed doors/cabinets.</li>
Spaces to hide:
<li>Because rats are prey animals, they need spaces to hide to feel comfortable.</li>
<li>Provide cardboard boxes or old sheets where the rats can burrow.</li>
Spaces to climb:
<li>Rats love to climb, hence try to allow them to climb where they want.</li>
<li>If the climbing spot is not safe close it off by using pet fences or an improvised fence from e.g., big container lid.</li>
<li>If possible, get them a cat tree to climb onto. </li>
