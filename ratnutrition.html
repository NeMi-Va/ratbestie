          <p>
            Use a special premade mix or rat pellets bought from a store.<br>
            You can also make your own rat food mix:<br>
            <a href="http://www.isamurats.co.uk/options-for-dry-mixes.html">Making the rat food mix</a><br>
            If you notice that your rats are being picky and not eating a certain part of the mix switch to pellets. <br>
            Try to use multiple types of pellets from different companies as it warrants that they get an appropriate number of different types of nutrients.

        <h2>Feeding:</h2>
        <div class="grid-container2">
          <p> Feed your rats 1-2 times a day.<br>
            An adult rat needs around 60 calories/day.<br>
            Amount of food following your used food brand recommendation or generally 15-20 grams/average adult rat/day. So, if you are feeding your rat twice a day that would mean 7-10 grams/feeding/rat. <br>
