            You can always research on the internet any questions regarding your rat's health for example whether thay can eat a certain food.<br>
            Personally, I have found Rat Forums very useful as there people share their personal experiences and often there one can find good answers to a very specific problem. <br>
            But despite the usefulness a person with no experience will never be better than a professional in the field.<br>
            Remember it is always better to go to a vet and regret a big bill for nothing than to mourn a loss of you small friend.<br>
            Here is a website I have found the most useful in choosing when it is time to go to a vet:<br>
